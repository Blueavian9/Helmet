# Helmet
Helmet helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.  All your code for these lessons goes in the myApp.js file between the lines of code we have started you off with. Do not change or delete the code we have added for you.  Helmet version 3.21.3 has already been installed, so require it as helmet in myApp.js.
